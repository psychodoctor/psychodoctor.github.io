            <b>The two examples above showcase the start and end of my design process
                I started out with a overly comlex design that while interesting was overly sensitive, and overly confusing. It also had far too much text for my liking, since i like a more minimalist approch to interactive graphics. 
                The Second example which is what i ended up going with, which is far more standered, but that allowed me to make it feel a lot better to use since it was not overly complex for the amouont of info that needed to be displayed.   
                Some other ideas that were tried in the interm that i did not illisttrate before implication, was a drag to change pie graph, however i had trouble with the drag function that caused lots of freezing, and a simple arrow system to change the graph, but the arrows were unneccary for the questions, as I only needed one graph.

                    The reason i decided to go with a more normal looking graph is due to what my goal was, my goal was to make a easialy readable graph, that you could interact with to get the infermation, so i decided that i wanted everything that was not hte graph to take second stage inclueding any infermation that would be given in a paragraph. this is why i have the infermation show up on the curser when you click the slices of the graph rather than bringing up a paragraph of needless text. The colors are ment to pop out without being overly bright, as to focuse the attention on the graph. the black backround is twofold, one i prefere a black backround when loooking at websites, the second reason is that it puts less stress on the eyes.

                    It helped me answer the question due how it shows the extreme that the question is asking, rather than an avarage. It also goes through what can be hard to understand data and showcases it in an easy to understan format.
